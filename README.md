# Campus Eats 
For this project, we have been tasked with implementing a rating system into an already existing food ordering system. The rating system will be for providing users with relevant information that may or may not affect their decision when choosing a restaurant or driver. The basic functionality will include viewing ratings, creating ratings, and administrative tools that will allow administrators to view analytical data about all of the restaurants and drivers in the system. On top of the implementation of the rating system, the provided database will also be modified to suit our needs.
